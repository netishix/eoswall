                <p>
                  The EOS Wall project was born as a proof of concept of EOS DAPP.
                  <br> Every user that has an EOS account can buy a portion of the wall called
                  <span class="font-weight-bold">slot</span>. A slot is composed by a title, an image and an url to redirect when the slot is clicked.
                  <br> All the slots are stored in the EOS blockchain and can be updated at anytime by it's owners.

              <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
                <p>
                  The price of a slot is calculated with the following formula:
                  <br>
                  <span class="font-weight-bold">
                    <span class="badge badge-primary">Slot price</span> =
                    <span class="badge badge-info">Pixel price</span> x
                    <span class="badge badge-info">Slot pixels</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                  The pixel price will change over time automatically depending on the total pixels that had been sold. It is calculated with the following lineal
                  functions:

                The RAM for every new slot stored in the wall is payed by the smart contract itself.

                  No, you can't. This app is not responsible for the content of external sites referenced by the slots.
                  <br> However, we make our best to constantly moderate the slots. Any slot considered malicious will be removed
                  from the wall.

              <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
                <p>
                  To buy or update a slot, it is necessary to interact with the EOS blockchain. Scatter extension has the ability to interact
                  with the blockchain by pushing and signing transactions safely using your browser.
