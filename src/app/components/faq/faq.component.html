            <ngb-panel title="¿What is The EOS Wall?">
              <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
                <p>
                  The EOS Wall project was born as a proof of concept of EOS DAPP.
                  <br> Every user the has an EOS account can buy a portion of the wall called <span class="font-weight-bold">slot</span>. A slot is composed by a title,
                  an image and an url to redirect when the slot is clicked.
                  <br> All the slots are stored in the EOS blockchain and can be updated at anytime by it's owners.

            <ngb-panel title="¿Who pays for RAM?">
              <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
                The RAM for every new slot stored in the wall is payed by the smart contract itself.

            <ngb-panel title="¿Will the wall be online forever?">
              <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
                That's our approach!
              </ng-template>
            </ngb-panel>
            <ngb-panel title="¿Can I trust the external links of the slots?">
              <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
                <p>
                  No, you can't. The EOS Wall is not responsible for the content of external sites referenced by the slots.
                  <br>
                  However, we make our best to constantly moderate the slots. Any slot considered malicious will be removed from the wall.

                <p>The smart contract has the following structure. For more information please refer to
                  the Ricardian Contracts attached to the smart contract.</p>

              <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
                <p>
                  To buy or update a slot, it is necessary to interact with the EOS blockchain. Scatter extension has the ability to interact
                  with the blockchain by pushing and signing transactions safely using your browser.
